# Cyber Kill Chain Lab

This is a lab is intended to show the cyber kill chain of an attack.
The lab internally uses a generated pcap -> Zeek -> Free version of Splunk
And etvx from attack data -> Free version of splunk

The goal is to show the flow of an attack at a very basic level. (with only stage 4/5 missing)

You should accept the splunk license in docker before doing stuff (uncomment line in docker compose)
And use software at your own risk.
